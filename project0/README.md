# Project 0

// Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I have created a personal portfolio of a Filmmaker. There are 4 html pages.

1. Home
2. About
3. Portfolio
4. Contact

-----------

1. In Homepage I have used bootstrap column to created 4 column to navigate to other pages

2. In About page I have used a image in the background of hero section with a Intro Text & color overlay in the image
Below that I have used bootstrap column for the image and her details. I have also used a CTA button there.
Below details I have created a table showing the awards.

// Stock in navbar & home opens an external link to youtube channel

3. In portfolio page I have showed different works in grid that links to an external website.

4. In contact I have used forms to send message to the filmmaker.
